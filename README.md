# Palm-Recognization
A program written in python using OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries, detects palm, shows the recognition points over the hand, and track in realtime, also it recognizes different gestures like - fist, open hand, etc.
(Also, there are two extra programs to identify the VideoCapture index easily and also check if the webcam is started successfully and frames are captured successfully or not)
